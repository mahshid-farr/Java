In this lab at fisrt I created two interfaces which keep my username and password information in Oracle databse
also they keep some basic information such as dirver and URL for connecting to database.

Then I created 2 classes:

One of the classes called  ShowEmployeeInfoByID  use input from user to query employees table by employee_id
(I couldn't use OCI driver, because I Downloaded it and add the path in my environmental variable of my windows)

Then in another class i worte a PL/SQL procedure to query first and last name of employee and total number of employees who works in specific department
